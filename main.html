                <abbr title="SANTO TOMAS COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE SCIENCES AND TECHNOLOGY">STCAST</abbr> was founded in 2018 under the administration of former Mayor Daniel Batosalem Jr. The establishment of the local college was perceived to be a hostile takeover in a bid to cease the operation and eventually replace the extension campus of the University of Southeastern Philippines (USEP). 

But the establishment and operation of STCAST that time was marred with irregularities. Whats more appalling was that the national government did not yet subsidize its operation like state-owned Universities and Colleges (SUCs). 

Tuition refunds for USEP coeds, delayed salaries of college teachers, and the flawed STCAST ordinance was among the issues and concerns that highlighted the major mess in STCAST overall operations. 

All these and more prompted the Evangelista administration to take a decisive step to solve the problems in the LGU-owned STCAST since the issues were lingering and were left unresolved during the Batosalem administration. </p>
